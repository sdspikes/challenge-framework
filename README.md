This repository contains two things:

* a node module for determining whether a snippet of JS code has certain properties (described in more detail below), and
* a basic webpage using that module which allows users to save and load tests, and a textarea for student code, which will have the tests run against it to check for validity


## Details
//TODO(sdspikes): fill this out
